pseudo-spectral methods
We close this section with a brief discussion of the numerical techniques used to
solve these equations. The workhorse of numerical methods in nonlinear fibre optics
is the split-step Fourier method, which essentially involves alternating between the
time- and frequency-domains in order to solve the nonlinear and linear terms in
Eq. (3.2) or Eq. (3.12) in the most natural and efficient way possible. This technique
is in the class of pseudo-spectral methods, which are commonly employed to deal
with stiff differential equations containing diffractive or dispersive terms. Using this
technique, the linear term is exactly accounted for in each step, as it is completely
integrable, whereas the nonlinear term is usually integrated using Runge¨CKutta
techniques.
